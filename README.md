# TESTER PORTFOLIO


## About me

Once a proofreader, today a digital bibliographer and a software tester. A few years ago, I made this path for myself and I follow it consistently, still learning new things. I have already gained the ISTQB Certificate and first experience on testing mobile and web applications. I am also Python enthusiast which I plan to use for automation testing.

MY TOP 5 CLIFTON STRENGTHS:
1. Futuristic
2. Deliberative
3. Discipline
4. Individualization
5. Focus

## Experience

Currently I work as an **Information and documentation specialist**.
I have experience in creating bibliographic records, running social media, creating promotional content, as well as in the analysis and processing of bibliographic data and also in software testing.
